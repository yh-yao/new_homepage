I am currently a GenAI Research Scientist at [TensorOpera AI](https://tensoropera.ai/home), working on the cutting-edge research of Generative AI.

I got my Ph.D. of Electrical Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in 2024, working with Prof. [Carlee Joe-Wong](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cjoewong/) who leads the [LIONS](https://research.ece.cmu.edu/lions/index.html) research group. 
I earned my Bachelor of Science degree at the IEEE Honor Class from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. [Xinbing Wang](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/) and [Luoyi Fu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fu-ly/), in 2019.

My research interests include <b>Federated Graph Learning</b> and <b>Generative AI</b>. <span style="color:red">Feel free to contact me if you have some research ideas or industry collaborations.</span>
